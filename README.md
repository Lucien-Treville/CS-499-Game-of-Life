# CS 499 Capstone Project
## Game of Life

This project was originally developed as part of a group project for the UAH Computer Science Capstone Project course (CS499). The project currently features a fictional ecosystem simulator with predators, herbivores, and plants. Users may initialize the environment with a JSON file or by using the Drag-N-Drop menu. 

### Current Features
- Friendly UI
- JSON parser and Drag-N-Drop menu for ecosystem initialization
- Statistics and data visualization screen after simulation ends
- Genetic drift between parents and children. (not visualized yet)

### Why fork this project? (aka To-Do)
I would like to continue developing this simulation by improving current features and implementing new features:
- Creature state machine rework (Unsatisfied with group result, state machines need improvement)
- Genetic drift visualizer
- Customizable environments (currently hard coded to a basic island)
- Controllable character?
- Migrate to newest LTS version of Unity


### Running the Simulation
You have two options:
1. Clone this repo and run the executable in BuiltProject.
2. Clone this repo and import the project into Unity. I recommend using Unity version 2020.3.48f1 for compatibility, at the moment.


### Random

Here are my favorite screenshots of the simulation.
